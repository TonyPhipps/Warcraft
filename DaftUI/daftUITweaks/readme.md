Quality of life visual changes to the default UI

Intentionally lightweight on cpu/memory/load times. This comes with one downside... Most setting changes require /reload ui after checking/unchecking them in the Interface Options > Addons panels. This allows for far less code to manage flipping toggles back and forth.
